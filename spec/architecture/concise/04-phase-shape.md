# Phase 4: Shape (22 Transformation Passes)

## Overview

The **Shape phase** transforms CLR semantics → TypeScript semantics through 22 sequential transformation passes. Creates compatibility plans for emission. Each pass is pure, returning new immutable SymbolGraph or plan.

**Input:** SymbolGraph (from Normalize, with indices)
**Output:** SymbolGraph (TypeScript-ready, unnamed) + 4 Shape plans

**Plans created:**
- `StaticFlatteningPlan` (Pass 4.7) - Static hierarchy flattening
- `StaticConflictPlan` (Pass 4.8) - Static conflict detection
- `OverrideConflictPlan` (Pass 4.9) - Override conflict detection
- `PropertyOverridePlan` (Pass 4.10) - Property type unification

**Algorithm:**
1. For each type
2. Group ViewOnly members by InterfaceSource
3. For each interface:

## Pass 4.7 (19): StaticHierarchyFlattener.Build

**Purpose:** Plan flattening for static-only inheritance hierarchies

**Input:** SymbolGraph
**Output:** (SymbolGraph, StaticFlatteningPlan)

**Algorithm:**
1. **Identify static-only types:**
   - No instance members (only static/const)
   - Base class (if any) also static-only or is Object
2. **Collect inherited static members:**
   - Walk full base hierarchy recursively
   - For each base class: Collect all static methods/properties/fields
   - Track original declaring type for each member
3. **Create flattening plan:**
   - Map: StaticOnlyTypeStableId → List<(MemberStableId, DeclaringType)>
   - Plan stores which members to inherit and from where
4. **Return:** (SymbolGraph unchanged, StaticFlatteningPlan)

**Impact:** Eliminates TS2417 for SIMD intrinsics (~50 types)

**Example:** `Vector128<T>` inherits static members from base `Vector128`

**Files:** `Shape/StaticHierarchyFlattener.cs`

---

## Pass 4.8 (20): StaticConflictDetector.Build

**Purpose:** Detect static member conflicts in hybrid types (both static and instance members)

**Input:** SymbolGraph
**Output:** StaticConflictPlan

**Algorithm:**
1. **Identify hybrid types:**
   - Has both static and instance members
   - Has base class
2. **Find static conflicts:**
   - For each static property/method/field in type
   - Walk base hierarchy
   - If base class has static member with same name:
     - Add to conflict set for this type
3. **Create conflict plan:**
   - Map: HybridTypeStableId → Set<ConflictingStaticMemberName>
   - Plan stores which static members shadow base statics
4. **Return:** StaticConflictPlan

**Impact:** Eliminates TS2417 for Task<T> and similar hybrid types (~4 types)

**Example:** `Task<T>.Factory` shadows `Task.Factory`

**Files:** `Shape/StaticConflictDetector.cs`

---

## Pass 4.9 (21): OverrideConflictDetector.Build

**Purpose:** Detect instance member override conflicts (same-assembly only)

**Input:** SymbolGraph
**Output:** OverrideConflictPlan

**Algorithm:**
1. **For each type:**
   - Walk base hierarchy (same assembly only)
   - For each property in current type:
     - Find property with same name in base
     - If exists and types incompatible:
       - Add to conflict set
   - For each method in current type:
     - Find method with same name/arity in base
     - If exists and signatures incompatible:
       - Add to conflict set
2. **Create conflict plan:**
   - Map: DerivedTypeStableId → Set<ConflictingInstanceMemberName>
   - Plan stores which instance members have incompatible overrides
3. **Return:** OverrideConflictPlan

**Impact:** Reduced TS2416 by 44% (same-assembly cases)

**Limitation:** Only detects when both base and derived in same SymbolGraph

**Files:** `Shape/OverrideConflictDetector.cs`

---

## Pass 4.10 (22): PropertyOverrideUnifier.Build

**Purpose:** Unify property types across inheritance hierarchies via union types

**Input:** SymbolGraph
**Output:** PropertyOverridePlan

**Algorithm:**

**Step 1: For each type:**
1. Build full inheritance chain (base → derived)
   - Walk base hierarchy
   - For cross-assembly bases: Lookup by ClrFullName in TypeIndex
   - Handle assembly forwarding (lookup by ClrFullName, not StableId)

**Step 2: For each property in type:**
1. Walk inheritance chain collecting properties with same name
2. Extract property types from chain
3. **Check if types vary:**
   - If all types identical: Skip (no unification needed)
   - If types differ: Proceed to unification

**Step 3: Compute union type:**
1. Collect distinct type strings
2. Create union: `Type1 | Type2 | Type3 | ...`
3. **Safety filter: Skip if property uses generic type parameters:**
   - Check if property type is GenericParameterReference
   - Or if property type is NamedTypeReference with TypeArguments containing GenericParameterReference
   - Reason: Generic parameters like T, TKey, TValue cause TS2304 errors
   - Examples to skip: `level: T`, `items: Array<TKey>`

**Step 4: Create plan entry:**
1. Map: PropertyStableId → UnifiedUnionTypeString
2. Example: `"System.Net.HttpRequestCachePolicy::level"` → `"HttpRequestCacheLevel | HttpCacheAgeControl"`

**Step 5: Return PropertyOverridePlan with all unifications**

**Impact:** Eliminated final TS2416 error → **zero TypeScript errors**

**Statistics:** 222 property chains unified, 444 union entries created

**Safety:** Generic filter prevents TS2304 errors from leaked type parameters

**Assembly forwarding fix:** Lookup base types by ClrFullName instead of StableId to handle cross-assembly forwarding

**Files:** `Shape/PropertyOverrideUnifier.cs`

---

## Output State After Shape

- All members have `EmitScope` determined (ClassSurface, ViewOnly, or Omitted)
- All transformations complete
- `TsEmitName` still null (assigned in Phase 3.5)
- **Plans created:**
  - `StaticFlatteningPlan`: Static-only types → inherited static members
  - `StaticConflictPlan`: Hybrid types → conflicting static member names
  - `OverrideConflictPlan`: Derived types → incompatible instance override names
  - `PropertyOverridePlan`: Properties → unified union type strings

**Data flow:** SymbolGraph + 4 Plans → Phase 3.5 (Name Reservation)

---

## Summary

The Shape phase transforms CLR semantics to TypeScript through 22 passes:
1. **Interface processing** (1-6): Flatten hierarchies, synthesize members, resolve diamonds
2. **Member handling** (7-16): Add overloads, mark indexers, deduplicate, plan views
3. **Static hierarchy** (4.7-4.8): Flatten static-only types, detect hybrid conflicts
4. **Override handling** (4.9-4.10): Detect instance conflicts, unify property types

**Key achievements:**
- Eliminates TS2417 errors (static hierarchy issues)
- Reduces TS2416 errors (override conflicts)
- Final pass (4.10) achieves **zero TypeScript errors** via property type unification
- Creates compatibility plans for plan-based emission

**Critical ordering:**
- StructuralConformance BEFORE InterfaceInliner (needs original hierarchy)
- InterfaceInliner BEFORE ExplicitImplSynthesizer (needs flattened interfaces)
- Passes 4.7-4.10 MUST run LAST (create plans based on all prior transformations)
